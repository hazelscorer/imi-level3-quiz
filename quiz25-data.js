    {
      question: "What should carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels normally be higher than by volume in exhaust gases?",
      options: [
        "5%",
        "14%",
        "25%",
        "50%"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "With effective combustion, the chemical elements carbon and oxygen combine to form carbon dioxide (CO₂). This should normally be higher than 14% by volume. Carbon dioxide can be used as an effective diagnostic gas and can give a good indication of engine mechanical operation and condition."
    },
    {
      question: "What should hydrocarbon (HC) levels be kept under at idle (parts per million)?",
      options: [
        "50 ppm",
        "200 ppm",
        "500 ppm",
        "1000 ppm"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "If fuel passes through the combustion process with no chemical change, hydrocarbons (HC) are given off. These should be kept as low as possible, usually under 200 parts per million at idle. High values of hydrocarbons normally give an indication of an engine misfire."
    },
    {

        "A compression gauge",
        "A vacuum pump"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "During the annual MOT inspection, light vehicle exhaust emissions are tested to make sure they conform to strict limits. Petrol vehicles are tested using an exhaust gas analyser that measures the specific quantities of gaseous emissions at the tail pipe."
    },
    {
      question: "What are diesel engine vehicles tested for during MOT?",
      options: [
        "Gaseous emissions only",
        "The amount of smoke or particulate matter produced at the exhaust tail pipe using a smoke meter",
        "Oil consumption",
        "Fuel pressure"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "During an MOT test, diesel engine vehicles are tested for the amount of smoke or particulate matter produced at the exhaust tail pipe. A smoke meter is attached to the car at the tail pipe and the engine is revved up. An opacity meter in the smoke tester measures the exhaust gas to see if it falls within preset limits."

      options: [
        "Euro 3",
        "Euro 4",
        "Euro 5",
        "Euro 6"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Exhaust emission standards are continually being updated and revised, with Euro 4 being the most common standard currently. The stricter Euro 5 regulations are now compulsory for all new cars currently on sale in the UK."

      question: "What precious metals are contained in the mesh-style matrix inside a catalytic converter?",
      options: [
        "Gold and silver",
        "Platinum and rhodium",
        "Copper and zinc",
        "Iron and nickel"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "From the outside, a catalytic converter may look similar to an exhaust system silencer. On the inside, it is normally made up of a matrix-style mesh which contains precious metals such as platinum and rhodium."
    },
    {
      question: "Where is a catalytic converter normally mounted in the exhaust system?",
      options: [
        "At the rear of the exhaust",
        "Very close to the inlet manifold where the exhaust gases exit the cylinder head",
        "Under the fuel tank",
        "Near the muffler only"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "A catalytic converter is normally mounted in the exhaust system very close to the inlet manifold where the exhaust gases exit the cylinder head. (The closer the catalytic converter is to the exiting exhaust gases, the quicker it heats up and begins to operate in an efficient manner.)"
    },
    {
      question: "What does the reduction converter in a catalytic converter do?",
      options: [
        "Increases fuel flow",
        "Strips the nitrogen molecules from any oxides of nitrogen and retains them in the catalyst, while allowing the oxygen to continue",
        "Adds oxygen to exhaust",
        "Cools the exhaust gases"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "When the exhaust gas comes into contact with the reduction catalyst (see Figure 3.55 – reduction converter) a chemical reaction takes place that strips the nitrogen molecules from any oxides of nitrogen and retains them in the catalyst, while allowing the oxygen to continue."
    },
    {
      question: "What does the oxidation converter do in a catalytic converter?",
      options: [
        "Removes all oxygen",
        "Recombines hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide with some of the remaining oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water",
        "Increases NOx production",
        "Filters particulate matter"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "When the exhaust gases come into contact with the oxidation catalyst (see Figure 3.55 – oxidisation converter) a chemical reaction takes place which recombines hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide with some of the remaining oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water."
    },
    {
      question: "What does SCR stand for?",
      options: [
        "Standard Catalyst Reaction",
        "Selective Catalytic Regeneration",
        "Secondary Combustion Recovery",
        "Spark Control Relay"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "SCR stands for Selective Catalytic Regeneration. On some three-way catalytic converters, oxides of nitrogen are removed using a chemical reaction."
    },
    {
      question: "What chemical is typically used in SCR systems that must be topped up according to the manufacturer's maintenance schedule?",
      options: [
        "Water",
        "Urea-based chemical",
        "Gasoline",
        "Antifreeze"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Some engine management systems achieve this by changing their fuel injection program to make the system run rich – this alters the chemical processes going on inside the catalytic converter, helping to remove the nitrogen molecules. Other systems have a reservoir containing a special chemical, normally based on urea. This is injected into the exhaust gas before the catalytic converter and alters the processes going on inside the catalytic converter, helping to remove the nitrogen molecules. This chemical additive is a service item that must be topped up according to the manufacturer's maintenance schedule."

      question: "What does DPF stand for?",
      options: [
        "Direct Petrol Filter",
        "Diesel Particulate Filter",
        "Digital Pressure Feedback",
        "Dynamic Power Flow"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "DPF stands for Diesel Particulate Filter. A diesel particulate filter can be mounted in the exhaust system of a compression ignition powered car to help remove soot and other small contaminate particles that are produced during the combustion cycle."
    },
    {
      question: "What should a car fitted with a DPF show when running in good working order?",
      options: [
        "Black smoke",
        "No visible smoke from the tailpipe",
        "White smoke",
        "Blue smoke"

      question: "What does EGR stand for?",
      options: [
        "Engine Gas Reduction",
        "Exhaust Gas Recirculation",
        "Electronic Governor Relay",
        "Emergency Gear Release"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "EGR stands for Exhaust Gas Recirculation. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can be used as an emission control system to reduce the production of oxides of nitrogen (NOx)."
    },
    {
      question: "How does EGR reduce NOx production in a petrol engine?",
      options: [
        "By increasing fuel flow",
        "By introducing exhaust gas back into the inlet manifold, reducing the amount of incoming air and fuel that reaches the cylinder, which means performance output is reduced and engine temperatures will be lower",
        "By adding more oxygen",
        "By increasing compression"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "EGR is a method for taking some of the burnt exhaust gases and directing them through pipes or galleries back into the inlet manifold. By introducing exhaust gas back into the inlet manifold of a petrol engine, the amount of incoming air and fuel that reaches the cylinder is reduced. This means that the performance output of the engine is reduced, and so engine temperatures will be lower. This helps prevent the production of NOx."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is it important that EGR performance is not affected during most operating conditions?",
      options: [
        "To maintain emissions compliance",
        "A device called an EGR lift valve is fitted so that exhaust gas is only recirculated when outright performance or acceleration are not required",
        "To increase fuel consumption",
        "To reduce engine life"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "It is important that performance is not affected during most of the operating conditions under which a car is driven. A device called an EGR lift valve is fitted so that exhaust gas is only recirculated when outright performance or acceleration are not required. For example, when cruising on a motorway at a steady speed with your foot resting only lightly on the accelerator pedal, exhaust gas can be recirculated and the production of NOx reduced."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is achieving ideal air/fuel ratios of 14.7:1 difficult in diesel engines for EGR?",
      options: [
        "Diesel has too much oxygen",
        "Diesel engines draw the same amount of air every time, and it is the amount of fuel that is injected that dictates how fast the engine will run",
        "Diesel burns too quickly",
        "Diesel engines don't have throttles"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "In a diesel engine, it is very difficult to achieve ideal air/fuel ratios of 14.7:1 because diesel engines draw the same amount of air every time, and it is the amount of fuel that is injected that dictates how fast the engine will run. This means that when a standard diesel engine is operating under normal conditions, the air/fuel ratio will be extremely weak at low revs and idle, and rich during acceleration."
    },
    {
      question: "What does EVAP stand for?",
      options: [
        "Electronic Valve Actuation Protocol",
        "Evaporative Emission Control",
        "Engine Vacuum Adjusted Pressure",
        "Exhaust Volume Air Pump"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "EVAP stands for Evaporative Emission Control. Petrol fumes are a pollutant and because of this, fuel tanks are sealed to reduce the possibility of fumes escaping into the atmosphere."
    },
    {
      question: "Where are evaporated fuel vapours stored in an EVAP system?",
      options: [
        "In the exhaust pipe",
        "In a charcoal canister",
        "In the fuel tank only",
        "In the engine oil"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "If the tank has nowhere to store these evaporated fumes, high pressures could build up in the tank, causing leaks or damage. The vapours must be captured, stored and disposed of in an environmentally friendly way. Fuel emission vapours are stored in a charcoal canister."
    },
    {
      question: "What temperature causes the fumes in an EVAP system to be vented and burnt along with the rest of the air/fuel mixture?",
      options: [
        "25°C",
        "Above 55°C",
        "10°C",
        "100°C"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "When the engine temperature is above 55°C the fumes are vented and burnt along with the rest of the air/fuel mixture. This enables all of the hydrocarbon (HC) vapours to go through the combustion process and eliminate these polluting emissions. This system is called an evaporative emission system (EVAP)."
    },
    {
      question: "What does PCV stand for?",
      options: [
        "Primary Crankcase Valve",
        "Positive Crankcase Ventilation",
        "Petrol Control Valve",
        "Pressure Check Valve"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "PCV stands for Positive Crankcase Ventilation. Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) was introduced in the 1960s and marked the beginning of evaporative emission control systems in the cars to help control pollution."
    },
    {
      question: "What is 'blow-by' in relation to PCV systems?",
      options: [
        "Exhaust leaks",
        "When the compressed fuel/air mixture is forced past the seal created between the piston ring and the cylinder wall",
        "Turbocharger failure",
        "Fuel pump malfunction"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "The initial purpose of the PCV system was to capture crankcase vapours and prevent them from being passed into the atmosphere through atmospheric breather pipes. Combustion chamber gasses are able to escape into the crankcase through a process known as 'blow-by'. Blow-by occurs when the compressed fuel/air mixture is forced past the seal created between the piston ring and the cylinder wall."
    },
    {
      question: "What was the early form of fuel injection that preceded direct injection into cylinders?",
      options: [
        "Port fuel injection",
        "Single point or throttle body fuel injection - fuel was injected into the intake manifold rather than directly into the cylinder",
        "Carburetor only",
        "No fuel injection existed"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Although fuel injection systems have been around for a long time, early systems were mechanical. They relied on fuel distributed to the correct injectors under pressure, similar to the method used in standard diesel engines (although the fuel was injected into the intake manifold, rather than directly into the cylinder). These early mechanical fuel injection systems were an improvement on carburettors, but were still inaccurate in many ways."
