    {
      question: "What is the ideal air/fuel ratio for correct combustion by mass (weight)?",
      options: [
        "10.7:1",
        "14.7:1",
        "18.7:1",
        "20.7:1"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "An ideal air/fuel ratio for correct combustion is 14.7:1 by mass (weight). This means that the amount of air in the combustion mixture will weigh 14.7 times more than the amount of fuel. The air/fuel ratio is maintained at 14.7:1 by mass, and ignition timing is advanced or retarded, as required."

    {
      question: "What is pre-ignition?",
      options: [
        "Normal spark plug operation",
        "A condition where the air/fuel mixture ignites before the operation of the spark plug, normally a result of a combustion chamber deposit (carbon build-up) which is burning/glowing red hot and will act as an alternative source of ignition",
        "Delayed ignition timing",
        "Spark plug failure"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Pre-ignition normally occurs on petrol engine vehicles. This is a condition where the air/fuel mixture ignites before the operation of the spark plug. Pre-ignition is normally a result of a combustion chamber deposit (carbon build-up) which is burning/glowing red hot and will act as an alternative source of ignition."

      question: "What is detonation?",
      options: [
        "Normal combustion",
        "A condition that exists when the fuel in the combustion chamber spontaneously ignites due to a rapid rise in heat, normally created by compression pressures",
        "Spark plug wear",
        "Exhaust backfire"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Detonation is a condition that exists when the fuel in the combustion chamber spontaneously ignites due to a rapid rise in heat, normally created by compression pressures. This can occur in both petrol and diesel engines. Fuel droplets begin to burn in a number of different places at once, and the collision of flame fronts as they spread out creates a distinctive knocking noise; this is particularly apparent in diesel engines."

    {
      question: "What is pinking in relation to combustion?",
      options: [
        "Normal engine sound",
        "A condition that occurs when the ignition of the air/fuel mixture happens too early in the combustion cycle, most commonly due to over-advanced ignition timing",
        "Fuel pump noise",
        "Valve clatter"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Pinking is a condition that occurs when the ignition of the air/fuel mixture happens too early in the combustion cycle. The most common reason for this is over-advanced ignition timing on petrol engines or over advanced injection on diesel engines. This results in the pressure build-up occurring before the piston and the connecting rod have reached the required position after top dead centre."

      question: "What is octane rating?",
      options: [
        "The color of petrol",
        "A measurement of petrol's resistance to detonation, i.e. how stable the fuel is under compression pressures",
        "The viscosity of fuel",
        "The temperature of fuel"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "The octane rating of a fuel refers to petrol. It is a measurement of petrol's resistance to detonation, i.e. how stable the fuel is under compression pressures. The higher the octane rating, the more stable the fuel is and therefore the more suitable it is for high performance or high compression engines. Fuel is classified with a research octane number (RON), which helps to identify its properties."
    },
    {
      question: "What is cetane rating?",
      options: [
        "A measurement for petrol",
        "A measurement of diesel's delay period, i.e. how quickly it will ignite and burn after injection",
        "The color of diesel",
        "The weight of fuel"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "The cetane rating of a fuel refers to diesel. It is a measurement of diesel's delay period, i.e. how quickly it will ignite and burn after injection. The higher the cetane rating, the shorter the delay period and the faster the ignition of the fuel. A diesel fuel with a high cetane rating is desirable for good combustion and performance, as it gives a smooth and even flame spread within the combustion chamber."

        "The weight of the fuel",
        "The smell of the fuel"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Volatility refers to a fuel's ability to vaporise at certain temperatures. Petrol is a volatile fuel which turns into a vapour readily at room temperature. Diesel is less volatile and needs its temperature to be raised before it will vaporise. The volatility of a fuel is important as it is the vapour of a fuel that burns, not the liquid."

    {
      question: "What is calorific value?",
      options: [
        "The temperature of the fuel",

        "The color of combustion"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "The calorific value of a fuel is a measurement of the heating power it contains. It refers to the amount of energy released when the fuel is burned under specified conditions. The amount of energy stored in a fuel depends on its composition and, as a result, different fuels have different values."
    },
    {
      question: "What is flash point?",
      options: [
        "The boiling point of fuel",
        "The lowest temperature at which a fuel will vaporise to form an ignitable mixture in air",
        "The freezing point of fuel",
        "The maximum temperature fuel can reach"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Flash point is the lowest temperature at which a fuel will vaporise to form an ignitable mixture in air. Because of the volatility of petrol, it has a lower flash point than diesel."
    },
    {
      question: "What does hydrocarbon content refer to?",
      options: [
        "The water content of fuel",
        "How much hydrogen and carbon the fuel contains - this reflects the number of carbon molecules in the hydrocarbon chain",
        "The oxygen content",
        "The nitrogen content"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Whether a fuel is petrol or diesel depends on how much hydrogen and carbon the fuel contains. This reflects the number of carbon molecules in the hydrocarbon chain. The amounts can differ slightly depending on how the fuel is refined, but as a general rule: When the chain has between five and nine carbons, the hydrocarbon is petrol. When the chain has about twelve carbons, the hydrocarbon is diesel."

        "100% oxygen",
        "30% oxygen, 70% carbon dioxide"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "During the induction process, air is mixed with fuel to form an ignitable mixture – because oxygen is required for combustion. At sea level, air is composed of approximately 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen (plus 1% other gases)."

      question: "What is carbon monoxide and why is it harmful?",
      options: [
        "A harmless gas",
        "A product of incomplete combustion that is harmful to health; it is colourless, odourless and tasteless, but if inhaled it replaces oxygen in the blood and starves the organs of required oxygen",
        "Pure oxygen",
        "Water vapor"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "If during the combustion process, the burning fuel goes out, perhaps due to lack of oxygen or rapid cooling, carbon monoxide (CO) is produced. Carbon monoxide is a product of incomplete combustion and is harmful to health. It is colourless, odourless and tasteless, but if inhaled it replaces oxygen in the blood and starves the organs of required oxygen."
