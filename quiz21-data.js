If a spark is required every fourth stroke, that's 50 sparks per second for each cylinder."

      question: "Why do narrow pointy electrodes not last very long due to spark erosion?",
      options: [
        "They conduct electricity poorly",
        "Due to high temperatures and spark erosion, the sharp edges begin to erode and round off, reducing overall spark plug performance",
        "They are made of weak materials",
        "They corrode too easily"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Unfortunately, due to high temperatures and spark erosion, narrow pointy electrodes do not last very long. As a result, the electrodes found on a standard spark plug are machined flat with sharp edges, allowing sparks to be created at a number of points. Over time, the sharp edges will begin to erode and round off. This reduces the overall performance of the spark plugs."
    },
    {
      question: "What precious metals are used in spark plug production to overcome spark erosion issues?",
      options: [
        "Gold and silver",

      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "To overcome this issue, a number of precious and rare metals, such as platinum and iridium, are used in the production of spark plugs. This means they are less prone to spark erosion and can be manufactured with smaller sharper electrodes."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if spark plug gaps are larger than recommended by the manufacturer?",
      options: [
        "The engine will run cooler",

        "The engine produces more power"
      ],
      correct: 1,

    {
      question: "What should you NOT use when testing the primary coil circuit?",
      options: [
        "An LED test lamp",

      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "From the left-hand voltage axis, you should see a 12V trace. As the ignition coil begins its charge time (dwell period), the voltage will fall to zero. It will continue to charge until the primary circuit is broken."
