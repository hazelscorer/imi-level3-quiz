# imi-level3-quiz
Quizes for mechanic apprentices studying for their level 3 IMI qualification. The quizzes are based on a book by Graham Stoakes covering most of the material necessary for mechanics studying for their IMI Level 3 exams. However these quizzes can be used for revision by anyone studying for Level 3 IMI Mechanic Exams with or without this book.
